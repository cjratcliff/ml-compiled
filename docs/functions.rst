Functions
""""""""""""

Bijective
-----------
A function that is both `surjective <https://ml-compiled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#surjective>`_ and `injective <https://ml-compiled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#injective>`_.

Codomain
-----------

Concave
----------
A function is concave if:

.. math::

  f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha) y) \geq \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y)

Contrast with convex.

Continuous
---------------


Convex
--------
A function is convex if:

.. math::

  f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha) y) \leq \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y)

:math:`x^2` is an example of a convex function.

Contrast with concave.

Domain
--------
The set of points the function is defined for.

Image
-------


Injective
-----------
A function is injective if it never maps two different inputs to the same output.

See also: surjective, bijective

Monotonic
-----------
A function is monotonic if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Surjective
-------------
A function is surjective if, for every possible output, there is one input that produces that output.
