Instance segmentation
------------------------
Unlike semantic segmentation, different instances of the same object type have to be labelled as separate objects (eg person 1, person 2). Harder than semantic segmentation.

Region of interest
--------------------
A region in an image (usually defined by a rectangle) identified as containing an object of interest with high probability, relative to the background.

Saliency map
---------------
A heatmap over an image which shows each pixel's importance for the classification.

Semantic segmentation
------------------------
Partitions an object into meaningful parts with associated labels. May also be referred to as per-pixel classification. Contrast with instance segmentation.

Weakly supervised segmentation
--------------------------------
Segmentation trained only on images with one or more class labels. There are no ground truth segmentations available.
