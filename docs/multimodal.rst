Multimodal learning concerns tasks which require being able to make sense of multiple types of input, such as images and text, simultaneously.

Datasets
------------

CLEVR
_________
Dataset for visual question answering. Given a scene of coloured 3D shapes the algorithm must answer questions such as *"What color is	the	cube to the	right of the yellow sphere?"* and *"How	many cylinders are in	front of the small	
thing	and	on the left side of the green object?"*.

Notable results:

* `Learning Visual Reasoning Without Strong Priors, Perez et al. (2017) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03017.pdf>`_

| **Introduced in**
| `CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning, Johnson et al. (2016) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06890.pdf>`_
