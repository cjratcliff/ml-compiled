Bagging
--------
A way to reduce overfitting by building several models independently and averaging their predictions. As bagging reduces variance it is well suited to models like decision trees as they are prone to overfitting.

Boosting
----------
Build models sequentially, each one trying to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. AdaBoost is an example.
