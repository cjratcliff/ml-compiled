Hessian matrix
==========

Square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. Its size and therefore cost to compute is quadratic in the number of parameters. This makes it infeasible to compute for most problems. If the Hessian at a point on the loss surface has no negative eigenvalues the point is a local minimum.
